# SDR-Splitter-Switcher-by-WA2FZW
This is a device that allows one to simultaneously receive on
a ham radio transceiver (or any receiver) and an SDR.

I use it primarily with my 6 meter radio on the digital modes
(FT8, MSK144 and Q65) along with an RSPdx SDR. I find that I
get more decodes on the SDR than on the radio and the S/N ratio
on the SDR decodes are generally better than the decodes on the
radio.

It can also be used with any of the SDR control programs that
support thatever SDR you use (I use SDR Console) to provide
a panadapter capability for radios that don't have that option.
