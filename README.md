# SDR-Splitter-Switcher-by-WA2FZW
This is a device that allows one to simultaneously receive on
a ham radio transceiver (or any receiver) and an SDR.

I use it primarily with my 6 meter radio on the digital modes
(FT8, MSK144 and Q65) along with an RSPdx SDR. I find that I
get more decodes on the SDR than on the radio and the S/N ratio
on the SDR decodes are generally better than the decodes on the
radio.

It can also be used with any of the SDR control programs that
support whatever SDR you use (I use SDR Console) to provide
a panadapter capability for radios that don't have that option.

The only change in version 2.0 is that I changed the splitter used.
Version 1.0 used the Minicircuits PCS-2-1 RF Splitter. That device
was only rated to 400 MHz, so the performance of the unit on the
70cm band was less than optimum.

In version 2.0, I used the Minicircuits ADP-2-1W+ Power Splitter.
It is rated to 650 MHz and is less than half the cost of the
PCS-2-1.

There is some improvement on the 70cm band, but not as much as I
had hoped.
